        <h2>Web Developer - Student</h2>

        <p>This is my third semester at Wake Tech studying Web Development. So far I am enjoying my classes very much, and have learned a great
          deal. I first became interested in front-end developing when I was a teenager styling my MySpace pages using HTML and CSS and knew that I 
          would love to start a career developing web pages. It wasn't until I was an adult that I had the opportunity to pursue a degree in this field.

          <p>Vicious Cycles was a project done in an earlier web design course. This course focused on the basics of HTML and CSS including functional website navigation,
            image sizing, social media links, form elements and most importantly how to design a responsive web site adaptable to different sized viewports.
